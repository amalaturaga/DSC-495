# DSC-495
This is a final project for DSC 495: Special topics in Data Science.

My project group and I conducted exploratory data analysis on 150+ USDA crop reports and NOAA climate data records to identify patterns in soybean planting and harvesting trends. We then modeled thhe relationship between planting dates, seasonal rainfall, and growing degree days using Python and Scipy, achieveing an R-squared value of 0.85 for curve fitting. From this we identified a 15% decrease in average growing season length over 10 years, which correlated to earlier planting dates that had higher temperatures. This then becamea an important observation as it could provide actionable insights that North Carolinian farmers could use.
