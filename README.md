# Soy Bean Crop Growth Analysis
This is a final project for DSC 495: Special Topics in Data Science. The focus of this class dealt with understanding the best ways to effectively analyze weather and climate data through visualization, graphs, and statistical analysis.

My final project conducted exploratory data analysis on 150+ USDA crop reports and NOAA climate data records to identify patterns in soybean planting and harvesting trends. We then modeled the relationship between planting dates, seasonal rainfall, and growing degree days using Python and Scipy, achieving an R-squared value of 0.85 for curve fitting. From this, we identified a 15% decrease in average growing season length over 10 years, which correlated to earlier planting dates with higher temperatures. This became an important observation as it could provide actionable insights that North Carolinian farmers could use.
